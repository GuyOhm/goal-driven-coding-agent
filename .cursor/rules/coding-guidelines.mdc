description: Coding Guidelines And Conventions 
alwaysApply: true

ALWAYS follow these rules while generating code:

## Code Quality & Style
- You MUST write clean, readable code with clear and explicit naming for functions, classes, and variables
- You MUST follow PEP 8 conventions for Python code (naming, spacing, line length, imports)
- You MUST use descriptive variable names (avoid single letters except in loops/comprehensions)
- You MUST keep functions focused on a single responsibility (SRP)

## Architecture & Design
- You MUST keep code modular, maintainable, and testable at all times
- You MUST use OOP principles and abstraction with Abstract Base Classes (ABC) for clean architecture
- You MUST apply SOLID principles when designing classes and modules
- You MUST separate concerns (business logic, data access, presentation)

## Type Safety & Documentation
- You MUST use type hints for all function signatures (parameters and return types)
- You MUST write clear docstrings for public classes, methods, and functions
- You MUST document complex logic with inline comments when necessary
- You MUST use Python 3.10+ type hint features when appropriate (Union `|`, Optional)

## Error Handling & Validation
- You MUST handle exceptions gracefully with specific exception types
- You MUST validate inputs at boundaries (API endpoints, function entry points)
- You MUST provide meaningful error messages for debugging
- You MUST use custom exceptions for domain-specific errors

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- You MUST write testable code with dependency injection where appropriate
- You MUST aim for high test coverage of critical business logic
- You MUST use pytest for testing with clear test names and structure
- You MUST mock external dependencies in unit tests

## Performance & Efficiency
- You MUST write efficient and modern Python code
- You MUST use appropriate data structures (sets for membership, dicts for lookups)
- You MUST leverage standard library and well-established third-party libraries
- You MUST avoid premature optimization (optimize only when needed and measured)

## Dependencies & Imports
- You MUST organize imports: standard library, third-party, local (per PEP 8)
- You MUST use absolute imports for clarity
- You MUST avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`)
- You MUST keep dependencies minimal and well-justified
