  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/connect/connect.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/connect/connect_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/connect/connect_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nCompute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.\n\nThe abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.\nTwo players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.\nThe player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.\nThe four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).\n\nYour goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).\nNote that all games need not be \"fair\".\n(For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)\n\nThe boards look like this:\n\n```text\n. O . X .\n . X X O .\n  O O O X .\n   . X O X O\n    X O O O X\n```\n\n\"Player `O`\" plays from top to bottom, \"Player `X`\" plays from left to right.\nIn the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.\n\n[hex]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29",
