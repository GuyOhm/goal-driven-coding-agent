Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nImplement a basic reactive system.\n\nReactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on how values are computed in terms of each other to allow a change to one value to automatically propagate to other values, like in a spreadsheet.\n\nImplement a basic reactive system with cells with settable values (\"input\" cells) and cells with values computed in terms of other cells (\"compute\" cells).\nImplement updates so that when an input value is changed, values propagate to reach a new stable system state.\n\nIn addition, compute cells should allow for registering change notification callbacks.\nCall a cell\u2019s callbacks when the cell\u2019s value in a new stable state has changed from the previous stable state.",
