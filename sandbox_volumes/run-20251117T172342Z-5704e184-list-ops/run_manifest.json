  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/list-ops/list_ops.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/list-ops/list_ops_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/list-ops/list_ops_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nImplement basic list operations.\n\nIn functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and `reduce` are very common.\nImplement a series of basic list operations, without using existing functions.\n\nThe precise number and names of the operations to be implemented will be track dependent to avoid conflicts with existing names, but the general operations you will implement include:\n\n- `append` (_given two lists, add all items in the second list to the end of the first list_);\n- `concatenate` (_given a series of lists, combine all items in all lists into one flattened list_);\n- `filter` (_given a predicate and a list, return the list of all items for which `predicate(item)` is True_);\n- `length` (_given a list, return the total number of items within it_);\n- `map` (_given a function and a list, return the list of the results of applying `function(item)` on all items_);\n- `foldl` (_given a function, a list, and initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the left_);\n- `foldr` (_given a function, a list, and an initial accumulator, fold (reduce) each item into the accumulator from the right_);\n- `reverse` (_given a list, return a list with all the original items, but in reversed order_).\n\nNote, the ordering in which arguments are passed to the fold functions (`foldl`, `foldr`) is significant.",
