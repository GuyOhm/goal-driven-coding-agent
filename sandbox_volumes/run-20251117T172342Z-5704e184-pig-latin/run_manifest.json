  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/pig-latin/pig_latin.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/pig-latin/pig_latin_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/pig-latin/pig_latin_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is to translate text from English to Pig Latin.\nThe translation is defined using four rules, which look at the pattern of vowels and consonants at the beginning of a word.\nThese rules look at each word's use of vowels and consonants:\n\n- vowels: the letters `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`\n- consonants: the other 21 letters of the English alphabet\n\n## Rule 1\n\nIf a word begins with a vowel, or starts with `\"xr\"` or `\"yt\"`, add an `\"ay\"` sound to the end of the word.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `\"apple\"` -> `\"appleay\"` (starts with vowel)\n- `\"xray\"` -> `\"xrayay\"` (starts with `\"xr\"`)\n- `\"yttria\"` -> `\"yttriaay\"` (starts with `\"yt\"`)\n\n## Rule 2\n\nIf a word begins with one or more consonants, first move those consonants to the end of the word and then add an `\"ay\"` sound to the end of the word.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `\"pig\"` -> `\"igp\"` -> `\"igpay\"` (starts with single consonant)\n- `\"chair\"` -> `\"airch\"` -> `\"airchay\"` (starts with multiple consonants)\n- `\"thrush\"` -> `\"ushthr\"` -> `\"ushthray\"` (starts with multiple consonants)\n\n## Rule 3\n\nIf a word starts with zero or more consonants followed by `\"qu\"`, first move those consonants (if any) and the `\"qu\"` part to the end of the word, and then add an `\"ay\"` sound to the end of the word.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `\"quick\"` -> `\"ickqu\"` -> `\"ickquay\"` (starts with `\"qu\"`, no preceding consonants)\n- `\"square\"` -> `\"aresqu\"` -> `\"aresquay\"` (starts with one consonant followed by `\"qu`\")\n\n## Rule 4\n\nIf a word starts with one or more consonants followed by `\"y\"`, first move the consonants preceding the `\"y\"`to the end of the word, and then add an `\"ay\"` sound to the end of the word.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- `\"my\"` -> `\"ym\"` -> `\"ymay\"` (starts with single consonant followed by `\"y\"`)\n- `\"rhythm\"` -> `\"ythmrh\"` -> `\"ythmrhay\"` (starts with multiple consonants followed by `\"y\"`)\n\n# Introduction\n\nYour parents have challenged you and your sibling to a game of two-on-two basketball.\nConfident they'll win, they let you score the first couple of points, but then start taking over the game.\nNeeding a little boost, you start speaking in [Pig Latin][pig-latin], which is a made-up children's language that's difficult for non-children to understand.\nThis will give you the edge to prevail over your parents!\n\n[pig-latin]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin",
