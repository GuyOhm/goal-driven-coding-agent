  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/grade-school/grade_school.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/grade-school/grade_school_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/grade-school/grade_school_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions append\n\nThe tests for this exercise expect your school roster will be implemented via a School `class` in Python.\nIf you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.\n\n[classes in python]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html\n\n# Instructions\n\nGiven students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.\n\nIn the end, you should be able to:\n\n- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade\n  - \"Add Jim to grade 2.\"\n  - \"OK.\"\n- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade\n  - \"Which students are in grade 2?\"\n  - \"We've only got Jim just now.\"\n- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.\n  Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.\n  - \"Who all is enrolled in school right now?\"\n  - \"Let me think.\n    We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.\n    So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim\"\n\nNote that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.\nIn fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.",
