  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/pov/pov.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/pov/pov_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/pov/pov_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions append\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`. \nThe tests will only pass if you both `raise` the expected `exception` type and include the expected message with it.\n\nPlease check the tests and their expected results carefully.\n\n# Instructions\n\nReparent a tree on a selected node.\n\nA [tree][wiki-tree] is a special type of [graph][wiki-graph] where all nodes are connected but there are no cycles.\nThat means, there is exactly one path to get from one node to another for any pair of nodes.\n\nThis exercise is all about re-orientating a tree to see things from a different point of view.\nFor example family trees are usually presented from the ancestor's perspective:\n\n```text\n    +------0------+\n    |      |      |\n  +-1-+  +-2-+  +-3-+\n  |   |  |   |  |   |\n  4   5  6   7  8   9\n```\n\nBut there is no inherent direction in a tree.\nThe same information can be presented from the perspective of any other node in the tree, by pulling it up to the root and dragging its relationships along with it.\nSo the same tree from 6's perspective would look like:\n\n```text\n        6\n        |\n  +-----2-----+\n  |           |\n  7     +-----0-----+\n        |           |\n      +-1-+       +-3-+\n      |   |       |   |\n      4   5       8   9\n```\n\nThis lets us more simply describe the paths between two nodes.\nSo for example the path from 6-9 (which in the first tree goes up to the root and then down to a different leaf node) can be seen to follow the path 6-2-0-3-9.\n\nThis exercise involves taking an input tree and re-orientating it from the point of view of one of the nodes.\n\n[wiki-graph]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)\n[wiki-tree]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)",
