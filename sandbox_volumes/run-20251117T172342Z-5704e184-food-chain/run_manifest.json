  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/food-chain/food_chain.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/food-chain/food_chain_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/food-chain/food_chain_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nGenerate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.\n\nWhile you could copy/paste the lyrics, or read them from a file, this problem is much more interesting if you approach it algorithmically.\n\nThis is a [cumulative song][cumulative-song] of unknown origin.\n\nThis is one of many common variants.\n\n```text\nI know an old lady who swallowed a fly.\nI don't know why she swallowed the fly.
