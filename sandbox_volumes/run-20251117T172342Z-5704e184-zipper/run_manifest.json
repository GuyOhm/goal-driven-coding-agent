Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nCreating a zipper for a binary tree.\n\n[Zippers][zipper] are a purely functional way of navigating within a data structure and manipulating it.\nThey essentially contain a data structure and a pointer into that data structure (called the focus).\n\nFor example given a rose tree (where each node contains a value and a list of child nodes) a zipper might support these operations:\n\n- `from_tree` (get a zipper out of a rose tree, the focus is on the root node)\n- `to_tree` (get the rose tree out of the zipper)\n- `value` (get the value of the focus node)\n- `prev` (move the focus to the previous child of the same parent,\n  returns a new zipper)\n- `next` (move the focus to the next child of the same parent, returns a\n  new zipper)\n- `up` (move the focus to the parent, returns a new zipper)\n- `set_value` (set the value of the focus node, returns a new zipper)\n- `insert_before` (insert a new subtree before the focus node, it\n  becomes the `prev` of the focus node, returns a new zipper)\n- `insert_after` (insert a new subtree after the focus node, it becomes\n  the `next` of the focus node, returns a new zipper)\n- `delete` (removes the focus node and all subtrees, focus moves to the\n  `next` node if possible otherwise to the `prev` node if possible,\n  otherwise to the parent node, returns a new zipper)\n\n[zipper]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_%28data_structure%29",
