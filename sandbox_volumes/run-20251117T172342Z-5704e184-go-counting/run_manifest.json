  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/go-counting/go_counting.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/go-counting/go_counting_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/go-counting/go_counting_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions append\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when given invalid coordinates. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# when the coordinates for the piece are invalid\nraise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')\n```\n\n# Instructions\n\nCount the scored points on a Go board.\n\nIn the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, c\u1edd v\u00e2y and w\u00e9iq\u00ed) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.\nThe encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.\n\nCalculate the territory of each player.\nYou may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.\n\nDetermine the territory which includes a specified coordinate.\n\nMultiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.\nIn the following diagram the stones which matter are marked \"O\" and the stones that don't are marked \"I\" (ignored).\nEmpty spaces represent empty intersections.\n\n```text\n+----+\n|IOOI|\n|O  O|\n|O OI|\n|IOI |\n+----+\n```\n\nTo be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.\n\nFor more information see [Wikipedia][go-wikipedia] or [Sensei's Library][go-sensei].\n\n[go-wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29\n[go-sensei]: https://senseis.xmp.net/",
