  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/beer-song/beer_song.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/beer-song/beer_song_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/beer-song/beer_song_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nRecite the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite: 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.\n\nNote that
