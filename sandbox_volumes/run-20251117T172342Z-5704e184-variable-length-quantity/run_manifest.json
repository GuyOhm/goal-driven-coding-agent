  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/variable-length-quantity/variable_length_quantity.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/variable-length-quantity/variable_length_quantity_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/variable-length-quantity/variable_length_quantity_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions append\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` if the sequence to decode or encode is incomplete. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# if the sequence is incomplete\nraise ValueError(\"incomplete sequence\")\n```\n\n# Instructions\n\nImplement variable length quantity encoding and decoding.\n\nThe goal of this exercise is to implement [VLQ][vlq] encoding/decoding.\n\nIn short, the goal of this encoding is to encode integer values in a way that would save bytes.\nOnly the first 7 bits of each byte are significant (right-justified; sort of like an ASCII byte).\nSo, if you have a 32-bit value, you have to unpack it into a series of 7-bit bytes.\nOf course, you will have a variable number of bytes depending upon your integer.\nTo indicate which is the last byte of the series, you leave bit #7 clear.\nIn all of the preceding bytes, you set bit #7.\n\nSo, if an integer is between `0-127`, it can be represented as one byte.\nAlthough VLQ can deal with numbers of arbitrary sizes, for this exercise we will restrict ourselves to only numbers that fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer.\nHere are examples of integers as 32-bit values, and the variable length quantities that they translate to:\n\n```text\n NUMBER        VARIABLE QUANTITY\n00000000              00\n00000040              40\n0000007F              7F\n00000080             81 00\n00002000             C0 00\n00003FFF             FF 7F\n00004000           81 80 00\n00100000           C0 80 00\n001FFFFF           FF FF 7F\n00200000          81 80 80 00\n08000000          C0 80 80 00\n0FFFFFFF          FF FF FF 7F\n```\n\n[vlq]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity",
