  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/transpose/transpose.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/transpose/transpose_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/transpose/transpose_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nGiven an input text output it transposed.\n\nRoughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:\n\n```text\nABC\nDEF\n```\n\nis given by:\n\n```text\nAD\nBE\nCF\n```\n\nRows become columns and columns become rows.\nSee [transpose][].\n\nIf the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:\n\n- Pad to the left with spaces.\n- Don't pad to the right.\n\nTherefore, transposing this matrix:\n\n```text\nABC\nDE\n```\n\nresults in:\n\n```text\nAD\nBE\nC\n```\n\nAnd transposing:\n\n```text\nAB\nDEF\n```\n\nresults in:\n\n```text\nAD\nBE\n F\n```\n\nIn general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.\nThat means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s), the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).\n\n[transpose]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose",
