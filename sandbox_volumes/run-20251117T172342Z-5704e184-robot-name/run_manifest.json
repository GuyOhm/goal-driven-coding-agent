Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nManage robot factory settings.\n\nWhen a robot comes off the factory floor, it has no name.\n\nThe first time you turn on a robot, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.\n\nEvery once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that its name gets wiped.\nThe next time you ask, that robot will respond with a new random name.\n\nThe names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.\nUsing random names means a risk of collisions.\nYour solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.",
