  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/proverb/proverb.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/proverb/proverb_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/proverb/proverb_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions append\n\nIn [concept:python/unpacking-and-multiple-assignment](https://github.com/exercism/python/tree/main/concepts/unpacking-and-multiple-assignment), you learned multiple techniques for working with `lists`/`tuples` of arbitrary length as well as function arguments of arbitrary length.\nThis exercise would be a great place to practice those techniques.\n\n## How this exercise is implemented for Python\n\nThe test cases for this track add an additional keyword argument called `qualifier`.\nYou should use this keyword arguments value to modify the final verse of your Proverb.\n\n# Instructions\n\nFor want of a horseshoe nail, a kingdom was lost, or so the saying goes.\n\nGiven a list of inputs, generate the relevant proverb.\nFor example, given the list `[\"nail\", \"shoe\", \"horse\", \"rider\", \"message\", \"battle\", \"kingdom\"]`, you will output the full text of this proverbial rhyme:\n\n```text\nFor want of a nail the shoe was lost.\nFor want of a shoe the horse was lost.\nFor want of a horse the rider was lost.\nFor want of a rider the message was lost.\nFor want of a message the battle was lost.\nFor want of a battle the kingdom was lost.\nAnd all for the want of a nail.\n```\n\nNote that the list of inputs may vary; your solution should be able to handle lists of arbitrary length and content.\nNo line of the output text should be a static, unchanging string; all should vary according to the input given.",
