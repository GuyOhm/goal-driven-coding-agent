  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/hangman/hangman.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/hangman/hangman_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/hangman/hangman_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions append\n\n## Python Special Instructions\n\nA third party library **is not required** for this exercise.  Please ignore the instructions regarding **FRP library**.\n\n\n## Exception messages\n\nSometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.\n\nThis particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to \"throw\" a `ValueError` when the game has ended but the player tries to continue playing. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.\n\nTo raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:\n\n```python\n# when player tries to play, but the game is already over.\nraise ValueError(\"The game has already ended.\")\n```\n\n# Instructions\n\nImplement the logic of the hangman game using functional reactive programming.\n\n[Hangman][hangman] is a simple word guessing game.\n\n[Functional Reactive Programming][frp] is a way to write interactive programs.\nIt differs from the usual perspective in that instead of saying \"when the button is pressed increment the counter\", you write \"the value of the counter is the sum of the number of times the button is pressed.\"\n\nImplement the basic logic behind hangman using functional reactive programming.\nYou'll need to install an FRP library for this, this will be described in the language/track specific files of the exercise.\n\n[hangman]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29\n[frp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming",
