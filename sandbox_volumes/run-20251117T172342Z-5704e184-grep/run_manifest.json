  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/grep/grep.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/grep/grep_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/grep/grep_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nSearch files for lines matching a search string and return all matching lines.\n\nThe Unix [`grep`][grep] command searches files for lines that match a regular expression.\nYour task is to implement a simplified `grep` command, which supports searching for fixed strings.\n\nThe `grep` command takes three arguments:\n\n1. The string to search for.\n2. Zero or more flags for customizing the command's behavior.\n3. One or more files to search in.\n\nIt then reads the contents of the specified files (in the order specified), finds the lines that contain the search string, and finally returns those lines in the order in which they were found.\nWhen searching in multiple files, each matching line is prepended by the file name and a colon (':').\n\n## Flags\n\nThe `grep` command supports the following flags:\n\n- `-n` Prepend the line number and a colon (':') to each line in the output, placing the number after the filename (if present).\n- `-l` Output only the names of the files that contain at least one matching line.\n- `-i` Match using a case-insensitive comparison.\n- `-v` Invert the program -- collect all lines that fail to match.\n- `-x` Search only for lines where the search string matches the entire line.\n\n[grep]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html",
