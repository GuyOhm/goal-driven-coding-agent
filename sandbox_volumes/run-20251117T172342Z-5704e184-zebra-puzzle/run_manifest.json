  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/zebra-puzzle/zebra_puzzle.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/zebra-puzzle/zebra_puzzle_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/zebra-puzzle/zebra_puzzle_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\nYour task is to solve the Zebra Puzzle to find the answer to these two questions:\n\n- Which of the residents drinks water?\n- Who owns the zebra?\n\n## Puzzle\n\nThe following 15 statements are all known to be true:\n\n1. There are five houses.\n2. The Englishman lives in the red house.\n3. The Spaniard owns the dog.\n4. The person in the green house drinks coffee.\n5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.\n6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.\n7. The snail owner likes to go dancing.\n8. The person in the yellow house is a painter.\n9. The person in the middle house drinks milk.\n10. The Norwegian lives in the first house.\n11. The person who enjoys reading lives in the house next to the person with the fox.\n12. The painter's house is next to the house with the horse.\n13. The person who plays football drinks orange juice.\n14. The Japanese person plays chess.\n15. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\n\nAdditionally, each of the five houses is painted a different color, and their inhabitants are of different national extractions, own different pets, drink different beverages and engage in different hobbies.\n\n~~~~exercism/note\nThere are 24 billion (5!\u2075 = 24,883,200,000) possible solutions, so try ruling out as many solutions as possible.\n~~~~\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Zebra Puzzle is a famous logic puzzle in which there are five houses, each painted a different color.\nThe houses have different inhabitants, who have different nationalities, own different pets, drink different beverages and enjoy different hobbies.\n\nTo help you solve the puzzle, you're given 15 statements describing the solution.\nHowever, only by combining the information in _all_ statements will you be able to find the solution to the puzzle.\n\n~~~~exercism/note\nThe Zebra Puzzle is a [Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)][constraint-satisfaction-problem].\nIn such a problem, you have a set of possible values and a set of constraints that limit which values are valid.\nAnother well-known CSP is Sudoku.\n\n[constraint-satisfaction-problem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem\n~~~~",
