  "goal": "Your goal is to implement the file `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/scale-generator/scale_generator.py` so that all tests in `benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/scale-generator/scale_generator_test.py` pass.\nTo verify your solution, you must run the following command from the repository root (the sandbox root):\n`pytest benchmarks/python/exercises/practice/scale-generator/scale_generator_test.py`\n\n**Follow this workflow:**\n1. Read the solution file and the test file to understand the requirements.\n2. Implement the necessary changes in the solution file.\n3. Run the `pytest` command specified above.\n4. If tests fail, analyze the errors and repeat the process.\n5. If all tests pass, the goal is achieved.\n\nExercise instructions:\n# Instructions\n\n## Chromatic Scales\n\nScales in Western music are based on the chromatic (12-note) scale.\nThis scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:\n\n> A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, F, F\u266f, G, G\u266f\n\nA given sharp note (indicated by a \u266f) can also be expressed as the flat of the note above it (indicated by a \u266d) so the chromatic scale can also be written like this:\n\n> A, B\u266d, B, C, D\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, F, G\u266d, G, A\u266d\n\nThe major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch collection.\nThey have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.\nThe collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or flats, depending on the tonic (starting note).\nHere is a table indicating whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for a given tonic:\n\n| Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |\n| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |\n| Natural       | C                     | a                    |\n| Sharp         | G, D, A, E, B, F\u266f     | e, b, f\u266f, c\u266f, g\u266f, d\u266f |\n| Flat          | F, B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d | d, g, c, f, b\u266d, e\u266d   |\n\nNote that by common music theory convention the natural notes \"C\" and \"a\" follow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.\nFor the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.\n\n### Task\n\nGiven a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.\n\n- Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned starting with the given tonic.\n- For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats or sharps.\n- Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats) irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.\n\n## Diatonic Scales\n\nThe diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the chromatic scale, are built upon intervals.\nAn interval is the space between two pitches.\n\nThe simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a \"half step\", or \"minor second\" (sometimes written as a lower-case \"m\").\nThe interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called a \"whole step\" or \"major second\" (written as an upper-case \"M\").\nThe diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between adjacent notes.\n\nNon-diatonic scales can contain other intervals.\nAn \"augmented second\" interval, written \"A\", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D\u266d to E) or a \"whole step\" plus a \"half step\".\nThere are also smaller and larger intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.\n\n### Task\n\nGiven a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with the tonic and following the specified interval pattern.\n\nThis is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning 12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.\nThe first note is always the given tonic.\nThen, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.\n\nFor example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:\n\n| Note | Reason                                            |\n| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| G    | Tonic                                             |\n| A    | M indicates a whole step from G, skipping G\u266f      |\n| B    | M indicates a whole step from A, skipping A\u266f      |\n| C    | m indicates a half step from B, skipping nothing  |\n| D    | M indicates a whole step from C, skipping C\u266f      |\n| E    | M indicates a whole step from D, skipping D\u266f      |\n| F\u266f   | M indicates a whole step from E, skipping F       |\n| G    | m indicates a half step from F\u266f, skipping nothing |",
